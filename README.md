UFO sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of Project

This project helps Dana, a data journalist, create a website that will allow users to dynamically filter through a table populated by information from a JavaScript array. The goal is to have several filterable criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO observed. 

## Results

Using JavaScript, CSS, and html, a webpage was created to disseminate the UFO information. While the top of the page features a header and a few body paragraphs featuring a quote from a ufologist, the meat of the site is the interactive table at the bottom.

### Using the Table

As mentioned, there is opportunity to refine a search for UFO sightings based on five criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO observed. See [how the filters appear unused](). 

To change the filters, simply type in a date in the format suggested (MM/DD/YYYY), and/or keywords in the other boxes. Keep in mind the keywords are all case-sensitive, and the data has been entered in lowercase. 

The table will instantly filter down to match search criteria and will go completely empty if no matches are found. See [example filter set]().

## Summary

Overall, the webpage works as intended, and users are able to quickly and easily filter to their desired UFO search criteria. However, the design can be further improved.

### Suggestions for Improvement

As previously alluded to, a drawback of this filtering process is that it must case-match the results perfectly; if one were to search for "El Cajon," no results would be returned even though there are sitings for that location. Therefore, the first recommendation is to allow for flexibility in case when searching. Second, users might not be able to easily intuit all the different results for the "shape" parameter (i.e., "fireball," "formation"). It is recommended that the "shape" filter be changed to a drop-down menu that will allow searchers to see the options ahead of time.
